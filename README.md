=====

Open source concurrent high volume staged event-driven pipeline.

* Rapid software assembly
* Easy debugging, and monitoring
* Easy maintenance
* Built in concurrency
* Built in testing
* More Efficient
* No performance compromise


Garbage free message passing design eliminates garbage collector stalls providing predictable data rates.  

Lock free non-blocking message passing enables cores to make continuous progress at all times.

Staged pipeline scheduler enables optimization of the workload across cores.


Expected usage plan
-------------------

1. Define your data flow graph.
2. Define the contracts between each stage.
3. Test first development by using generative testing as the graph is implemented.
